# monet_paintings_gan
Notebook describing a CycleGAN trained to produce Monet-Style images. Made for the Something of a Painter [Kaggle Playground](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started)

# Problem Overview
This competition asks to create a Generational Adversarial Network, or GAN, to generate images in the style of Monet. This is utilized through a **discriminator** and **generator**, in which the generator attempts to "trick" the discriminator with generated images.

This notebook covers a CycleGAN architecture in TensorFlow
